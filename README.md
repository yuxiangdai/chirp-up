# ChirpUp

## How it works
Chirp-Up is a chatroom dedicated to promoting public discourse of commonly contentious topics. For each discussion question, users select their stances. Then, they will be presented with a list of users online with opposing stances, from which they can choose people to chat with based on their statements. When both sides accept the invitation, they can start chatting!

This application aims to give people the opportunity to discuss and debate with people harboring opposing viewpoints, fostering thought in a constructive environment.
